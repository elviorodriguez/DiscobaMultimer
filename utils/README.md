# Utils
`utils` contains several scripts to interact with the filesystems generated, being generated, or to be generated by DiscobaMultimer.

## annotate_AF2_models.sh
Utility to change the names of the filesystem from IDs to any name you want. It requires an `annotation.txt` TSV file with the correspondance between IDs and names (take a look at the example file).

```
# Usage:
$DiscobaMultimerPath/utils/annotate_AF2_models.sh <annotations_file> <AF2_folder_path>
```

## check_already_computed_AF2_models.sh
As its name suggests, it allows to check if all the IDs in the `IDs_table.txt` file were sucessfully predicted as AF2 models.

```
# Usage:
$DiscobaMultimerPath/utils/check_already_computed_AF2_models.sh <AF2_folder_path> <IDs_table.txt>
```

## check_if_IDs_are_in_proteome.sh
As its name suggests, it allows to check if all the IDs in the `IDs_table.txt` file are present in the `database.fasta` file. If all are present, you will get no output.


```
# Usage:
$DiscobaMultimerPath/utils/annotate_AF2_models.sh <database.fasta> <IDs_table.txt>
```

## check_if_PAIRS_are_in_MSA_folder.sh
As its name suggests, it allows to check if all the IDs in the `IDs_table.txt` file were already computed and present in an MSA directory.

```
# Usage:
$DiscobaMultimerPath/utils/annotate_AF2_models.sh <MSA_directory> <IDs_table.txt>
```

## extract_pLDDT_pTM_ipTM.sh
This is a useful script to retrieve quickly the mean pLDDT, pTM and ipTM metrics of each model in an AF2 directory.

```
# Usage:
$DiscobaMultimerPath/utils/annotate_AF2_models.sh <AF2_folder_path> <output_file_name>
```

You will get a TSV file with the following columns: ID1  ID2  rank  pLDDT  pTM  ipTM


## get_AF2_folder_for_PIDs.sh
Used to retreive PID information about currently running DiscobaMultimer calls.


```
# Usage:
$DiscobaMultimerPath/utils/get_AF2_folder_for_PIDs.sh all [pid] | PID1 PID2 ... PIDn

# Retrieve AF2 folder paths of currently running predictions
$DiscobaMultimerPath/utils/get_AF2_folder_for_PIDs.sh all

# Same, but include their PIDs
$DiscobaMultimerPath/utils/get_AF2_folder_for_PIDs.sh all pid

# Retrieve AF2 folder paths of a list of running PIDs
$DiscobaMultimerPath/utils/get_AF2_folder_for_PIDs.sh 6492 51234 6934
```

## shuffle_IDs.sh
Makes a random shuffle of the lines in `IDs_table.txt`.

```
# Usage
$DiscobaMultimerPath/utils/shuffle_IDs.sh `IDs_table.txt`
```
