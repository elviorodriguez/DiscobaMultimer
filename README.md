# DiscobaMultimer
DiscobaMultimer is designed to perform highthroughput complex predictions with AlphaFold2-multimer on Discoba species, using LocalColabFold as AF2 implementation. TaxIDs for Discoba species where added to allow the generation of multiple sequence alignments using Discoba database (DiscobaMSA) for complexes, combining it or not with the corresponding ColabFoldMSA generated by ColabFold MSA server. There is also an implementation to run monomer structure predictions or just MSA retrivals.

For MSA generation only, no GPU is required. Take a look at this Colab notebook:

For complex structure predictions, GPU is required. Take a look at this notebook:

For monomeric structure predictions, GPU is required. Take a look at this notebook:
