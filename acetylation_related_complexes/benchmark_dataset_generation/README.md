# Benchmark dataset generation
This contains the files needed to generate the benchmark dataset used in the original paper. It contains a file XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX with a manually curated database of INTERACTORS, taken from literature. Also contains an R script `generate_non_interacting_pairs.R` to generate the NON-INTERACTORS database `negative_interactors.xlsx` by randomly sampling pairs from `complex_components_xlsx`.
